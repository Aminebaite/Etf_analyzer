In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.

In this project, we will ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

For this Project, we need to create and submit the following deliverables:
A Jupyter notebook that contains the following:
The analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores.
Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.
A screenshot or video of the web application that you created by deploying your Jupyter notebook via the Voilà library.

Technologies :
This project leverages Anaconda and Jupyterlab with Python 3.7:

We need also to import the following libraries and dependencies :
1) Import numpy as np
2) import pandas as pd 
3) import hvplot.pandas
4) import sqalchemy

##Installation Guide The following PIP installation must be performed before running the program. 
They include: 
Jupyter lab
SQLachemy
